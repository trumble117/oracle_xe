# oracle_xe
Docker automated build for Oracle XE container

You must download oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip from Oracle and place it in the 'source' directory:

http://download.oracle.com/otn/linux/oracle11g/xe/oracle-xe-11.2.0-1.0.x86_64.rpm.zip

I have not yet inserted a way to grab it directly from Oracle due to the OTN Agreement, and it's too big to upload to GitHub.
